# GDG San Diego

This repo serves as a companion to events that GDG San Diego puts together as well as a collaborative environment for GDG members to practice working with tools weve covered, build upon or use for your own projects. We encourage community contributions and hope this serves you in your full stack development journey.

The repository is broken down into `web`, `mobile` and `backend` folders, each with their own guidelines for getting started.

## FAQ

#### I'm new here, how can I catch up on previous events?

All of our events are livestreamed on the [Think Outside The Valley](https://www.youtube.com/c/thinkoutsidethevalley) youtube chanel. You can also review the `starter` branch of each of the events for a snapshot in time of the topics covered up to and including that event.

#### How can I join future events?

You can become a member of the Google Devleoper Groups San Diego Chapter [Here](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-san-diego/). You will be notified as soon as a new event is scheduled, and you can RSVp to attend both virtually or in person.
